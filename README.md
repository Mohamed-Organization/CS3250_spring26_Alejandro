The pipeline automatically runs when code is pushed or a pull request is created.

The CI workflow performs the following steps:
1. Checks out the repository
2. Sets up a Node.js environment
3. Installs dependencies
4. Runs ESLint to check code quality

This helps ensure that all code added to the project meets our coding standards
